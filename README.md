- To avoid generating a branch or production deploy for a commit pushed directly to a branch, add [skip ci] or [skip netlify] anywhere in the Git commit message.

 - To avoid generating a branch or production deploy for multiple commits pushed together, add [skip ci] or [skip netlify] to the most recent commit, and it will apply to all other commits in the push.
